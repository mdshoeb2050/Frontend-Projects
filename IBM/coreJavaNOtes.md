Certainly! Below are condensed notes covering essential topics in Core Java:

### 1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts:
- **Abstraction:** Hiding complexity, showing only relevant details.
- **Encapsulation:** Binding data and methods into a single unit (class) and restricting access to certain parts.
- **Inheritance:** Acquiring properties and behavior of a parent class in a child class.
- **Polymorphism:** Objects of different types responding to the same message in different ways.

### 2. Data Types and Operators:
- **Primitive Data Types:** byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, boolean.
- **Wrapper Classes:** Classes corresponding to primitive types, e.g., Integer, Double, Boolean.
- **Operators:** Arithmetic, bitwise, relational, logical operators.

### 3. Control Flow:
- **Conditionals:** if-else, switch-case.
- **Loops:** for, while, do-while.

### 4. Arrays and Strings:
- **Arrays:** Collection of elements of the same type, indexed from 0.
- **Strings:** Immutable sequences of characters. String methods for manipulation.

### 5. Methods and Functions:
- **Method Signature:** Return type, method name, parameters, and access modifiers.
- **Overloading:** Methods with the same name but different parameters.
- **Overriding:** Redefining a method in a child class with the same signature as in the parent class.

### 6. Exception Handling:
- **try-catch-finally:** Handling exceptions.
- **Checked and Unchecked Exceptions:** Compile-time vs. runtime exceptions.
- **throw and throws:** Raising and declaring exceptions.

### 7. Collections Framework:
- **Lists, Sets, Maps:** Interfaces defining different types of collections.
- **ArrayList, LinkedList, HashSet, HashMap:** Common implementations.

### 8. Generics:
- **Parameterized Types:** Classes and methods that can work on any data type.
- **Wildcards:** Flexibility to accept a range of types.

### 9. Multithreading:
- **Thread Creation:** Extending Thread class or implementing Runnable interface.
- **Synchronization:** Controlling concurrent access to shared resources.

### 10. I/O Operations:
- **Input/Output Streams:** Reading and writing to files.
- **Serialization and Deserialization:** Converting objects into byte streams and vice versa.

### 11. Java Keywords:
- `static`, `final`, `this`, `super`, `abstract`, `volatile`, `synchronized`, and more.

### 12. Java Memory Management:
- **Heap and Stack:** Memory allocation for objects and method calls.
- **Garbage Collection:** Automatic memory management.

### 13. Java Annotations:
- **Built-in Annotations:** `@Override`, `@Deprecated`, `@SuppressWarnings`, etc.
- **Custom Annotations:** Creating annotations for specific purposes.

### 14. Java Reflection:
- **Inspecting Classes:** Retrieving information about classes, fields, methods at runtime.

### 15. Java 8 Features:
- **Lambda Expressions:** Anonymous functions.
- **Stream API:** Functional-style operations on collections.
- **Optional Class:** Handling potential null values.
- **Default Methods in Interfaces:** Adding new methods to interfaces without breaking implementing classes.
