While specific interview questions can vary, especially at a company like IBM, they often focus on fundamental programming concepts, data structures, and algorithms. Here's a list of common coding problems that are frequently asked in interviews for the role of Associate Software Engineer:

### 1. Arrays and Strings:
- **Array Manipulation:** Find maximum or minimum in an array, implement searching/sorting algorithms.
- **String Reversal or Manipulation:** Reverse a string, check for palindrome, or perform string manipulation.

### 2. Linked Lists:
- **Basic Operations:** Implement insertion, deletion, reversal, or detection of cycles in a linked list.

### 3. Stacks and Queues:
- **Stack Operations:** Implement stack with operations like push, pop, and check for balanced parentheses.
- **Queue Operations:** Implement queue with enqueue, dequeue, and variations.

### 4. Trees and Graphs:
- **Tree Traversal:** Perform pre-order, in-order, post-order traversals in a binary tree.
- **Graph Traversal:** Implement BFS or DFS for traversing a graph.

### 5. Recursion and Backtracking:
- **Factorial Calculation:** Implement factorial calculation using recursion.
- **N-Queens Problem:** Solve using backtracking.

### 6. Dynamic Programming:
- **Fibonacci Series:** Solve using dynamic programming to optimize recursive solution.
- **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS):** Find the LCS of two strings.

### 7. Searching and Sorting:
- **Binary Search:** Implement the binary search algorithm.
- **Merge Sort or Quick Sort:** Implement sorting algorithms.

### 8. Mathematical and Bit Manipulation:
- **Prime Number Verification:** Write a program to check if a number is prime.
- **Bitwise Operations:** Solve problems related to bit manipulation, such as finding the single non-repeating element in an array.

### Additional Tips:
- Be familiar with the time and space complexity of your solutions.
- Practice writing clean, efficient, and readable code.
- Understand the logic behind your solutions and be ready to explain your approach during the interview.

Preparing with these common coding problems will help you become more comfortable with problem-solving and coding challenges, enhancing your chances of success during the interview for the role of Associate Software Engineer at IBM.
