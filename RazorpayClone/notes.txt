Certainly! While I cannot provide the exact HTML code used by Razorpay (as that would be proprietary information),
I can offer a simplified example of how you might structure a landing page with similar components.
This is a basic representation and may not include all the intricacies and optimizations that a production-level codebase would have.

This is a basic HTML structure for a landing page with the mentioned components. 
For a complete and functional implementation, you'd need to create corresponding CSS styles and potentially include JavaScript for interactive features. 
Remember that the actual Razorpay website is likely to have a more complex structure with additional features, optimizations, and considerations.




Certainly! Below is a simplified example of CSS styles that could correspond to the HTML structure provided earlier. 
Please note that this is a basic representation, and the actual styles used by Razorpay would be more detailed and may involve additional considerations.


This CSS provides a basic styling structure for the HTML components. 
For a real-world application, you might need more sophisticated styles, and it's recommended to use a preprocessor like Sass or Less, as well as a build tool like webpack for optimizations. Additionally, responsive design has been considered with a simple media query for smaller screens. Adjustments may be needed based on the specific design requirements and the content of your landing page.
