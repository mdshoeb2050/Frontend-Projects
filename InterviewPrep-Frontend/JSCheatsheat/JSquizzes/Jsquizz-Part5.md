- Generate 10 code-based questions related to Modules and Bundlers in JavaScript, asking for the expected output or result.


# Here are ten code-based questions related to Testing, Libraries, and Frameworks in JavaScript, with the expected output or result:

1. **JavaScript Testing - Mocha & Chai**
    ```javascript
    // Q1.
    const assert = require('chai').assert;

    describe('Array', function() {
      it('should return -1 when the value is not present', function() {
        assert.equal([1, 2, 3].indexOf(4), -1);
      });
    });
    ```
    **Expected Output**: Test case verifying the absence of value 4 within the array [1, 2, 3]. Assertion should pass.

2. **Jest Testing - Mock Functions**
    ```javascript
    // Q2.
    const myMock = jest.fn();
    myMock('hello', 'world');
    
    console.log(myMock.mock.calls);
    ```
    **Expected Output**: The mock function `myMock` is called with 'hello' and 'world'. `myMock.mock.calls` will display an array containing information about the calls made to `myMock`.

3. **React Testing Library**
    ```javascript
    // Q3.
    import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
    import App from './App';

    test('renders welcome message', () => {
      render(<App />);
      const welcomeElement = screen.getByText(/Welcome/i);
      expect(welcomeElement).toBeInTheDocument();
    });
    ```
    **Expected Output**: Verifies if the text 'Welcome' is present in the rendered component 'App'.

4. **Jasmine Testing - Spies**
    ```javascript
    // Q4.
    function doSomething() {
      // some process
    }

    const spyOnDoSomething = spyOn(window, 'doSomething');
    doSomething();
    ```
    **Expected Output**: Jasmine's spy `spyOnDoSomething` spies on the `doSomething` function. Upon calling `doSomething()`, the spy monitors the function call.

5. **Mocha Testing - Asynchronous Testing**
    ```javascript
    // Q5.
    it('should resolve with the value "hello"', function() {
      return somePromiseFunction().then(function(data) {
        assert.equal(data, 'hello');
      });
    });
    ```
    **Expected Output**: Ensures the `somePromiseFunction()` resolves with the value 'hello'.

6. **Jest Testing - Snapshot Testing**
    ```javascript
    // Q6.
    import React from 'react';
    import renderer from 'react-test-renderer';
    import MyComponent from './MyComponent';

    test('renders correctly', () => {
      const tree = renderer.create(<MyComponent />).toJSON();
      expect(tree).toMatchSnapshot();
    });
    ```
    **Expected Output**: Captures and compares a snapshot of the rendered `MyComponent`, asserting that it matches the stored snapshot.

7. **Jest Testing - Mock Modules**
    ```javascript
    // Q7.
    jest.mock('axios');
    import axios from 'axios';

    axios.get.mockResolvedValue({ data: 'mocked data' });

    // ...code that uses axios.get

    expect(axios.get).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
    ```
    **Expected Output**: Mocks the `axios` module and ensures that `axios.get` is called exactly once.

8. **Cypress Testing - UI Automation**
    ```javascript
    // Q8.
    describe('Login functionality', function() {
      it('successfully logs in', function() {
        cy.visit('/login');
        cy.get('input[name="username"]').type('myUsername');
        cy.get('input[name="password"]').type('myPassword');
        cy.get('button[type="submit"]').click();
        cy.url().should('include', '/dashboard');
      });
    });
    ```
    **Expected Output**: Tests if the login functionality works by filling the form fields and clicking the submit button, then verifies the URL contains '/dashboard'.

9. **Jest Testing - Custom Matchers**
    ```javascript
    // Q9.
    expect.extend({
      toBeWithinRange(received, floor, ceiling) {
        const pass = received >= floor && received <= ceiling;
        if (pass) {
          return {
            message: () => `expected ${received} not to be within range ${floor} - ${ceiling}`,
            pass: true,
          };
        } else {
          return {
            message: () => `expected ${received} to be within range ${floor} - ${ceiling}`,
            pass: false,
          };
        }
      },
    });

    test('checks if a number is within a specified range', () => {
      expect(10).toBeWithinRange(0, 20);
    });
    ```
    **Expected Output**: Defines a custom matcher `toBeWithinRange` and verifies if the number 10 is within the range of 0 and 20.

10. **Jest Testing - Setup and Teardown**
    ```javascript
    // Q10.
    let data;

    beforeEach(() => {
      data = ['apple', 'orange', 'banana'];
    });

    test('data contains orange', () => {
      expect(data).toContain('orange');
    });

    afterEach(() => {
      data = [];
    });
    ```
    **Expected Output**: Demonstrates setup and teardown with `beforeEach` and `afterEach` hooks. Verifies if the array `data` contains the string 'orange' and clears the data array after the test.
